# Dual-Input-HSN-Validator
This notebook implements a dual‐input neural network using TensorFlow/Keras that  feeds the HSN code (character‐level) into a bidirectional LSTM to learn valid patterns and catch subtle typos.  
Before running the code, we first download or copy the Excel workbook HSN_SAC.xlsx (containing the HSN_MSTR and SAC_MSTR sheets) into a data/ folder at the root of this repository. Next, we update the DATA_PATH variable in both our notebook (notebooks/Dual_Input_HSN_Validator.ipynb) and our module (src/validator.py) to point to "data/HSN_SAC.xlsx", and we verify that the SHEET_NAMES mapping matches our sheet names. Once we’ve directed the code to data/HSN_SAC.xlsx, the data-loading routines will automatically ingest our master lists and the dual-input validation pipeline will run seamlessly.
